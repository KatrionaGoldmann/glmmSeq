Description: Using random effects, as as well as mixed effects, to model gene expression at an individual gene level. The most widely used mainstream differential gene expression analysis tools are all unable to fit mixed effects linear models. This package however fits negative binomial mixed effects models. The particularly useful for investigating the changes in gene expression between groups of individuals over time.
